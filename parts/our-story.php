		<h3 class="sub-section-title">About</h3>
		<p><strong>Kirstin</strong> was born in Birmingham, Alabama and went to school at the University of South Alabama. She currently works as a physical therapist in Rome, Georgia.</p>
		<p><strong>Chris</strong> was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and went to school at Full Sail University. He currently works as a web developer in Pensacola, Florida.</p>

		<h3 class="sub-section-title">How We Met</h3>
		<p>Kirstin went to school and became roommates and friends with Kelley Greathouse Stokes.  Kirstin moved to Rome to begin her new job, and Kelley moved back home to Pensacola after graduation.  When Chris moved to Pensacola, he met Kelley at church and became friends with her and her now husband, Shane.  Both Shane and Kelley thought that Chris and Kirstin would be a good match for each other, and it turns out they were right! </p>
		<p>Kirstin and some friends were passing through Pensacola for a night of mixed martial arts exhibition fighting, and she &amp; Chris were introduced over some pizza. Several months of long-distance communication &amp; a few visits later, they began dating and have been happy ever since!</p>

		<h3 class="sub-section-title">The Proposal</h3>
		<p>In July of 2013, Kirstin &amp; Chris went to Savannah Georgia for a week long vacation.  Sightseeing, history, great food, and good times were had.  One day in particular Chris planned the entire day as a surprise for Kirstin. They kayaked to a secluded island, visited a civil war fort, and finally went for a tour of the Tybee Island lighthouse.</p>
		<p>When they arrived at the lighthouse (driving in through the exit), the lighthouse appeared to be closed for the day, but this was part of the plan! After wandering around the parking lot looking for information about the lighthouse hours the keeper came out and explained that the lighthouse was closed, but decided to unlock the gate and let them in anyway (who does that?!?). Again this was part of the plan! In fact, when Kirstin wasnâ€™t looking, the lighthouse keeper wished Chris good luck!</p>
		<p>They climbed several hundred stairs to the top, and saw the beautiful view of Tybee Island just before sunset.  Chris began to talk about their visit to the Pensacola lighthouse on one of their first dates, and how much he enjoyed just being with Kirstin.  He then got down on one knee and asked her to marry him, and of course she said yes!</p>

		<p>Right before the wedding, Chris will move to Georgia.  The company he works for just opened an office in Atlanta, which couldn't have worked out better!  Kirstin will continue to work at her job in Rome while Chris will continue to work at his job, but now from the new location in Atlanta!  After the wedding Kirstin will move in with Chris and they will live somewhere in between the two cities in which they work.</p>
